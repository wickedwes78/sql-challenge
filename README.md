# sql-challenge

## Description
_Module 9 Challenge - University of Adelaide - Data Analytics BootCamp_

As a newly hired data engineer for Pewlett Hackard, I have been asked to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s.

The research was compiled by preparing a data model of the six provided csv files - see [ERD Diagram](ERD Diagram.png)
The relevant table schemas were then engineered - see [table_schema.sql](table_schema.sql).

Once the table schemas had been created and the csv files imported, I have answered the questions raised - see [data_analysis.sql](data_analysis.sql).

## How to Install and Run the Project

Please clone the repository to your local drive. Once cloned, the tables can be created via SQL apps such as pgAdmin4 after creating a database called sql-challenge.  Then the [data_analysis.sql](data_analysis.sql) can be run to find the answers to the queries raised.

## How to Use the Project

This project can be used to find some information about company employees during the 1980s and 1990s.
